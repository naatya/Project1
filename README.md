**Password-Strength-Analyzer-Tool**

I personally designed, engineered, and deployed this comprehensive security tool in Python to address critical gaps in user password awareness and vulnerability assessment.
The entire solution, from library installation on a non-standard OS (Kali/Windows) to the final Graphical User Interface (GUI), was built by me.

**Key Contributions & Technical Achievements:**

1.**Granular Analysis Engine:**
I implemented the Analyzer Module by integrating the complex zxcvbn library. My logic provides users with an objective score (0-4) and precise Estimated Crack Time, transforming abstract security concepts into tangible, actionable advice.

2.**Solving Real-World Attacks:**
The most challenging part was coding the Custom Wordlist Generator. I engineered the logic myself using Python's itertools to simulate highly effective, targeted dictionary attacks. This involved developing complex functions for:
Automatic Leet-speak substitutions (e.g., 'A' to '4' or '@').
Intelligent pattern appending (combining names, years, and symbols).

3.**Professional Deployment (GUI):** 
I developed the entire front-end using Tkinter, structuring the tool with a seamless tabbed GUI to cleanly separate the Analysis and Generation functions. This step was crucial for delivering a professional, user-friendly product over a simple command-line script.
This project demonstrates my proficiency in Python application development, cybersecurity tool creation, and overcoming complex integration challenges.
